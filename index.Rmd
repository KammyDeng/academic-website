#### Welcome to my website!
***
I graduated from the department of psychology at Guangzhou University in China with my Master of Education in Applied Psychology and Bachelor of Science. Currently, Iâ€™ve been working as a research fellow at the Centre for Psychometrics and Latent Variable Modeling at Guangzhou University in China.  
My research interests are focused on understanding the development of psychopathic traits and antisocial behaviors in youth. I am also interested in using multiple methods and statistical techniques, such as meta-analysis and network analysis. Additionally, I am interested in interdisciplinary research, particularly using novel approaches such as machine learning and data mining.
