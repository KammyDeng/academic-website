#### Welcome to my website!
***
I graduated from the department of psychology at Guangzhou University in China with my Master of Education in Applied Psychology and Bachelor of Science. Currently, Iâ€™ve been working as a research fellow at the Centre for Psychometrics and Latent Variable Modelling at Guangzhou University in China.  
My research interests focus on the understanding of the development of psychopathic traits and antisocial behaviours in youth. Also, I'm interested in using meta-analysis and network analysis.
